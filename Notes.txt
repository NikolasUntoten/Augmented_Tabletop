CREATION
-Click the button and you will be taken to the creation session
-Edit any table settings BEFORE clicking the table
-Scan the table, and click the point where you want your virtual table to be centered at
-Try to get as much context as you can. View the table from different angles.
-The scanned table will be uploaded and shared (this may take a minute!)
-Mark down the table number (in the pause menu) and share it with your friends!
-Please note that tables are only valid for 24 hours. After this point, they are deleted, so save your scenes locally!!

JOINING
-Simply enter the table number the host gives you, and you're off!


SAVING / LOADING
- You can save the scene exactly how it is to your device, and load it later.


TIDBITS
- The host isn't responsible for the table - they can leave and the table will remain
- If the virtual table disappears on you, try leaving and rejoining. AR is finnicky!
